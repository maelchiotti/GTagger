# TODO

## Next version

- If the lyrics are discarded, then take the following song in the search list.

## Future

- Implement multiprocessing for searching for the lyrics, reading and saving the files.
- Improve performance when (de)selecting files using shortcuts. This will allow to enable the reset button only if at least one track has new lyrics.
- Re-implement the [light theme](https://github.com/maelchiotti/GTagger/tree/light_theme).
- Re-implement the compact mode.
