# TODO

## Next version

- Fix the save button staying active when removing a file that had new lyrics.

## Future

- Implement multiprocessing for searching for the lyrics, reading and saving the files.
- Improve performance when (de)selecting files using shortcuts. This will allow to enable the reset button only if at least one track has new lyrics.
- Re-implement the light theme.
- Re-implement the compact mode.
